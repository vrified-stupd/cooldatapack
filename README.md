# cooldatapack
A datapack for the Bunker Minecraft Server.

This datapack is for moderation commands and custom commands for the player to use.

## Release builds

Release builds are builds of this datapack that are going to be used in the server. Nothing much aside from that.

## Developer Builds

Developer builds are test versions/builds of the datapack. Usually, suggestions go through the Developer builds first and then are added or rejected. Developer builds are less stable than the release builds and are **RARELY** used in the server.

## Current Features:

- Blacklisted items/blocks
- Freeze player function
- Custom Commands

## TODO

[] - More mod commands
